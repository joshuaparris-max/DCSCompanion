# Docs Index — DCS Companion

This folder contains copies and quick-start guides for core project documentation.

- `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` — step-by-step local setup and test checklist
- `AUTH_SETUP.md` — how authentication is wired and notes for production
- `FIREBASE_RULES.md` — suggested Firestore security rules (review before publishing)
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` — hosting and CI/CD deployment notes

These are copies of files from the repository root for easier access when browsing `/docs`.

If you update the root docs, reflect changes here for consistency.

# DCS Companion — Documentation

This `docs/` folder collects the main project documentation for easy reference.

Files included:

- `README.md` — project overview and quick start
- `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` — installation and local setup
- `AUTH_SETUP.md` — authentication implementation details
- `FIREBASE_RULES.md` — recommended Firestore security rules
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` — GitHub Pages + Firebase deployment instructions
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` — quick cheatsheet (if present in repo root)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` — implementation notes

If you want to keep a single canonical copy, delete the root-level documentation files and keep this folder. For now, these are copies to centralize docs.
